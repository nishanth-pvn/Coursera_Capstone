    "**Decathlon** is a French sporting goods retailer. With over 1500 stores in 49 countries, it is the largest sporting goods retailer in the world. It stocks a wide range of sporting goods for tennis rackets to advanced scuba diving equipment. Decathlon Group also owns over 20 brands with research and development facilities to develop the latest innovative designs registering up to 40 patents per year. Each brand represents a different sport or group of sports, with a dedicated product development and design team.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent global management discussion, it was decided to expand their presence in South East Asia especially Singapore. Plans are underway to open more retail outlets all over island to improve business. In addition, it becomes necessity to understand each locality in Singapore better based on top outdoor/recreational activities available in surrounding areas so that planned new outlets could sell right product in right places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing Consultants has determined that special attention needs to be given for top outdoor/recreational activities available in specific areas so that they can plan on products/brands which can be given importance in those areas as well as advertise them accordingly to have good reach among pubic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project will obtain information about neighborhoods in Singapore and make recommendations for Decathlon management to understand Singapore locality better for expanding their business. \n",

    "## Data\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "Required data can be gathered from:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Singapore regions information can be obtained from **Wikipedia**: [Regions of Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Singapore)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Inorder to make recommendations on suggested product brands in new retail outlets to be opened, Singapore segmentation will be made based   on different neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Full list of neighborhoods can be obtained from Wikipedia under Regions of Singapore, but only their names. They must be geolocated in order to use Foursquare services for obtaining venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For geolocation of neighborhoods **Python geocoder** will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Geocoder returns latitude and longitude information for every neighborhood center, then it will be used as main Foursquare API input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to obtain top attractions/recreational facilities in each locality we will use **[FOURSQUARE](https://foursquare.com/) API.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using services provided by Foursquare we can obtain top outdoor / recreational facilities for every neighborhood. Such services requires input geolocalization (i.e) latitude and longitude which we obtained in previous step.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook will be used for coding to process data and segment the neighborhoods in Singapore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following steps will be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Build Neighborhoods List**  \n",
    "\n",
    "A list of localities in Singapore based on regions is obtained from Wikipedia page. That list contains the names of the locality in every region.  \n",
    "As output a dataset containing a list of _\"region,locality\"_ is build.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**b) Neighborhoods GeoLocation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every element in the neighborhoods dataset is geolocated using _Python Geolocator_ and two new columns containing latitude and longitude were added for each locality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since geolocator service has frequent connection issues resulting in time out error, so to handle this information obtained is saved as a text file in CSV format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore this step can be run many times, invoking geolocator only for missing data (timed out errors in previous executions). After various executions all the neighborhoods geolocation is obtained and it's used in text file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**c) Venues Compilation (Using Foursquare API)**\n",
    "\n",
    "As next step Foursquare API services are used for obtaining venues for every neighborhood locality. The output is a new dataset with top three outdoor/recreational place in every neighborhood locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare Developer (Personal Account) with 99,500 regular calls/per day is used to extract required information. In order to minimize the usage of Foursquare, the information which have been extracted is saved in a text (CSV) file. Here it's assumed that information gathered doesn't change in short period of time. When the analysis needs to be re-done after long while then it's suggested to delete existing file's and regenerate them by calling Foursquare API service\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**d) Neighborhoods Segmentation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The business case in hand falls under unsupervised machine learning approach so K-means clustering algorithm was chosen for analysis.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * Taking in consideration that the venues information obtained from Foursquare is categorical, it must be previously processed in order to be handled by K-means algorithm. For this _\"pandas.get_dummies\"_ is used for dummies variables.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * The list of dummy variables obtained is then grouped as features of every neighborhood locality.\n",
    " \n",
    "    - After executing K-means algorithm the \"Elbow Curve\" it's plotted in order to obtain the _best K_. Analyzing the change in the slope of the       curve, it's determined that K=15 is a good value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - K-means algorithm is then executed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In next step segmented data-frame is built which is composed of the top three venues for every neighborhood locality plus a segment label         which is determined by K-means algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**e) Segment Cluster Analysis**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every segment is listed individually and it's further analyzed to derive meaningful insight as described in next section.\n",
    "\n"

Decathlon Group also owns over 20 brands with research and development facilities to develop the latest innovative designs registering up to 40 patents per year. Each brand represents a different sport or group of sports, with a dedicated product development and design team.

In recent global management discussion, it was decided to expand their presence in South East Asia especially Singapore. Plans are underway to open more retail outlets all over island to improve business. In addition, it becomes necessity to understand each locality in Singapore better based on top outdoor/recreational activities available in surrounding areas so that planned new outlets could sell right product in right places.

Marketing Consultants has determined that special attention needs to be given for top outdoor/recreational activities available in specific areas so that they can plan on products/brands which can be given importance in those areas as well as advertise them accordingly to have good reach among pubic.

Our project will obtain information about neighborhoods in Singapore and make recommendations for Decathlon management to understand Singapore locality better for expanding their business.
